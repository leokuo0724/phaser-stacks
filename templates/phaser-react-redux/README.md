# phaser-react-redux

A **standalone** starter: **React 18 + Phaser 3 + Redux Toolkit + Vite + TypeScript**,
demonstrating a clean responsibility split between the game core and the product shell.

Copy this folder anywhere — it has no dependency on the monorepo root, and works with any
package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun).

```bash
pnpm install     # or: npm install
pnpm dev         # http://localhost:5173   (or: npm run dev)
pnpm build       # type-check + production build
```

The demo is a 30-second "Popper": tap targets on the canvas to score. The game is
deliberately tiny — the point is the **architecture**, not the gameplay.

## What it shows

- React mounts the page; **Phaser renders underneath** as a transparent-overlay sibling.
- **Redux is the single source of truth** for `status / score / timeLeft / highScore /
difficulty`. Both layers read it.
- A **`StoreManager` bridge** lets the (hook-less) Phaser scene read and write that store.
- A **typed `mitt` event bus** carries _true one-off moments_ across the boundary
  (`ui:celebrate`, `game:hit`). Remembered state — including status transitions — goes
  through the store instead (see "store-first" below).
- 60fps data (sprite positions, tweens, timers) **stays inside Phaser** and never touches
  Redux.
- **Juice, code-only (zero image/audio assets):** particle bursts + camera-shake +
  squash-and-stretch + pooled score pops live in the Phaser scene
  ([`game/scenes/game-scene.ts`](src/game/scenes/game-scene.ts),
  [`game/juice/`](src/game/juice)); a drifting starfield in a sibling
  [`background-scene.ts`](src/game/scenes/background-scene.ts); a Web-Audio synth shared by
  both layers ([`shared/audio/`](src/game/../shared/audio)); and a **combo** system whose
  count lives in Redux and pulses in the HUD. All tunables sit in
  [`shared/rules.ts`](src/shared/rules.ts).

See [`../../docs/architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture.md) for the full rationale.

## Four cross-boundary patterns

Every message crossing the React ↔ Phaser boundary is one of four kinds — a 2×2 of
**direction** (who fires) × **kind** (a _noun_ that lives in state, or a _verb_ that flashes
by on the bus). The demo shows all four:

| Pattern                             | Example                                                                             | File                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Q1** Phaser → React, state (noun) | scene dispatches `registerHit` → HUD re-renders score/combo                         | [`game-scene.ts`](src/game/scenes/game-scene.ts) → [`Hud.tsx`](src/react/screens/Hud.tsx)                      |
| **Q2** Phaser → React, event (verb) | `game:hit` → transient milestone toast (never stored)                               | [`game-scene.ts`](src/game/scenes/game-scene.ts) → [`ComboToast.tsx`](src/react/screens/ComboToast.tsx)        |
| **Q3** React → Phaser, state (noun) | pause-menu difficulty switch → scene `subscribe` re-arms spawn cadence live         | [`DifficultyPicker.tsx`](src/react/ui/DifficultyPicker.tsx) → [`game-scene.ts`](src/game/scenes/game-scene.ts) |
| **Q4** React → Phaser, event (verb) | 🎉 button emits `ui:celebrate` → confetti burst (the _only_ bus verb, no noun form) | [`Hud.tsx`](src/react/screens/Hud.tsx) → [`game-scene.ts`](src/game/scenes/game-scene.ts)                      |

Turn on **X-Ray** (press `x`) to watch Q2 and Q4 stream through the event-bus log as they fire.

### Store-first: the status family travels through state, not the bus

The criterion is **該記住的進 store，一次性的走 event bus** — state worth remembering goes to
the store; only true one-shots take the bus. Round start / pause / resume / quit are _status
transitions_, and a status is remembered state, so they are dispatched to Redux (`startGame`,
`pauseGame`, …); the scene drives its round lifecycle by diffing `status` inside its store
subscription. This buys three debug wins: one funnel (a single breakpoint in the scene's
store-change handler catches every React→Phaser flow), full Redux DevTools visibility of every
transition, and reproducibility from a state snapshot. Only `ui:celebrate` — a pure verb with
no noun form — is left on the bus. The intent-carrying-events style (a `ui:start` verb the
scene listens for) is a valid alternative; this template picks store-first.

## The data flow in one tap

1. **Start** (UI) → `dispatch(startGame())`; status goes `idle → playing`.
2. `GameScene`'s store subscription sees the `idle → playing` transition, reads `difficulty`
   via the bridge, and starts its timers. (No `ui:start` event — the status change is the
   signal.)
3. Tap a target (canvas) → scene `dispatch(registerHit())` + `emitter.emit("game:hit")`.
4. The HUD re-renders the score/combo from Redux; the scene fires the particle burst and a
   pooled `+N` pop on the canvas from the same moment.
5. Countdown hits 0 → scene `dispatch(endGame())`; status goes `playing → over` and the UI
   shows the game-over screen because `status === "over"`. (Again no event: the scene reacts
   to its own transition as an idempotent no-op, having already stopped the round.)

## X-Ray Mode — make the architecture visible

The boundaries this template is about are normally invisible. **X-Ray mode** turns them on:
press **`x`** (or tap the **X-RAY** chip in the corner, or load with **`?xray=1`**) and the
four moving parts light up, each in its layer's colour.

<!-- TODO: xray.gif -->

| Colour      | Layer           | What you see                                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blue**    | React (DOM)     | An outline + name chip on every UI component (`Hud`, `MainMenu`, `Button`, …).               |
| **Orange**  | Phaser (canvas) | A bounding box + type label around every live display object (`Image(target)`).              |
| **Neutral** | Redux (store)   | A panel of the game slice's values (`status / score / timeLeft / …`) that flashes on change. |
| —           | Event bus       | A live log of every `mitt` event, coloured by direction: `ui:*` blue, `game:*` orange.       |

Each colour maps to one architecture layer, so a glance shows you which layer owns what and —
in the event log — exactly which messages cross the boundary and in which direction.

The toggle itself rides the architecture it illustrates: React owns the on/off state and
publishes it as a typed **`debug:xray`** event on the bus; the Phaser `XrayScene` listens and
wakes or sleeps. No globals cross the boundary. When off, the DOM outlines are inert CSS and
the scene sleeps, so X-Ray costs nothing until you switch it on. See
[`../../docs/architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture.md) §9.

## Swapping the state library

Because game code only touches Redux through `store-manager.ts`, porting to Zustand (or
anything else) means rewriting **that one file** plus `store/`. The scenes, the event bus,
and the responsibility split stay identical. That is the whole point of the bridge.

## Next steps for a real game

- Add scenes under `game/scenes/` and register them in `game-config.ts`.
- Add store slices under `store/<feature>/` and combine them in `store/index.ts`.
- Add real assets: replace the generated texture in `boot-scene.ts` with `this.load.*`.
- Want iOS/Android? Use the sibling
  [`phaser-react-redux-capacitor`](../phaser-react-redux-capacitor) template — same code
  plus a ready [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) setup (native persistence + haptics).
